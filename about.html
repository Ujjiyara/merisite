                    Hi, I'm Saksham — a passionate and curious computer science undergraduate at IIIT Hyderabad. I enjoy
                        solving real-world problems through code and building systems that make a meaningful impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in tech began with C programming, but I’ve since transitioned into C++ for its power and
                    flexibility, especially when dealing with graph algorithms and competitive programming. I also use
                    Python for data analysis and visualizations, particularly when prototyping ideas quickly and
                    efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a strong interest in automobiles — from performance benchmarks to market trends, I’m always
                    in tune with the latest car launches and engineering innovations. I combine this passion with
                    analytical thinking to explore insights about automotive design and consumer trends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the world of code and combustion engines, I have a deep appreciation for stand-up comedy.
                    Whether I’m watching Netflix specials or performing a tight 5-minute set at college open mics, I
                    love the craft of writing punchlines, understanding timing, and making people laugh. It keeps my
                    creativity alive, sharpens my storytelling, and reminds me not to take life too seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things is simply talking to people — about their ideas, their stories, or just
                    life in general. Meaningful conversations, spontaneous banter, and shared laughter are what fuel my
                    curiosity and keep me grounded.
                </p>
